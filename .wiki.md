# Project Summary
The PaperShare project is a web application aimed at facilitating the sharing of academic resources, specifically question papers and study notes, among students. Built using React and TypeScript, it integrates with Supabase for backend services, including user authentication and file storage, while also offering a localStorage fallback for demo purposes. The platform is designed to enhance academic collaboration and resource accessibility within educational institutions.

# Project Module Description
The project includes several key functional modules:
- **Authentication Module**: Manages user registration, login, and session management using Supabase.
- **File Upload Module**: Allows users to upload, categorize, and share academic resources.
- **Dashboard Module**: Provides users with statistics on their uploads, downloads, and points earned for contributions.
- **Search and Filter Module**: Enables users to find shared resources based on various criteria.
